   #  because k is an integer, n must be not only a divisor of G, but also it
   # should be an odd integer, in order to the equation be satisfied.
   # with this in hand, we can implement a naive solution in
   # wich n' is in [0, G/2] and is such that n = 2*n' + 1
   # This first idea is enough to pass Test Set 1

   # Second insight: actually, all divisors from a number can be obtained
   # iterating up to sqrt(G), so we can make this optimization to the code
