# Competitive Programming solutions

## Description

This repo contains my solutions to competitive programming problems from contests I have participated.

### Google's Coding Competitions

Google has mantained a coding competition tradition for years. First competition I heard about and started participating was Code Jam back to 2010. However, through the years, Google has increased the offer creating brand-new and interesting competitions, Kick Start and Hash Code included. It was just recently I discovered them but I hope to know more about these  and to start solving more problems  for fun and learning.

### Project Euler

ProjectEuler.net is a nice math problems site intended _for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context_, as stated in his description. It is also advised that the use of computer programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
