# Competitive Programming solutions

## Description

This repo contains my solutions to competitive programming problems from contests I have participated.

### Google's Coding Competitions

Google has mantained a coding competition tradition for years. First competition I heard about and started participating was Code Jam back to 2010. However, through the years, Google has increased the offer creating brand-new and interesting competitions, Kick Start and Hash Code included. It was just recently I discovered them but I hope to know more about these  and to start solving more problems  for fun and learning.

Until 2017, GCJ contests were flexible allowing participants to use language/computer package of their choice. It was possible to see exotic solucions like: [TeX](https://www.go-hero.net/jam/11/languages/TeX), [Spreadsheet](https://www.go-hero.net/jam/13/languages/Spreadsheet), [Prolog](https://www.go-hero.net/jam/11/languages/Prolog) and many others.

However, GCJ re-launched his platform in 2018, which came with some unfortunate changes,like not being able to see/download solutions linked in the last paragraph (so you will have to believe me those solutions were real).

### Project Euler

[ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a nice math problems site intended _for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context_, as stated in his own description. It is also advised that the use of computer programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

One rule of the site is that it is not possible to share solutions others than first one hundred problems, so this repo will contain only those solutions (of course, when I have solved those problems)
