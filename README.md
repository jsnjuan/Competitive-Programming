# Competitive Programming solutions

## Description

This repo contains my solutions to competitive programming problems from contests I have participated.

### Google's Coding Competitions

Google has mantained a coding competition tradition for years. First competition I heard about and started to participating was Code Jam back to 2010. However, through the years, Google has increased the offer creating two brand-new and interesting competitions: Kick Start and Hash Code. It was just recently I discovered them but I hope to know more about these  and to start solving more problems  for fun and learning.
